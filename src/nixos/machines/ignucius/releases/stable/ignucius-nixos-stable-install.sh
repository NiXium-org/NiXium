###! This script performs declarative installation of NiXium-Managed NixOS STABLE for the current system
###!
###! For that we utilize:
###! * Ragenix <https://github.com/yaxitech/ragenix> - The Rust implementation of agenix which is used to handle secrets in a declarative way
###! * Disko (specifically 'disko-install') <https://github.com/nix-community/disko> - NixOS utility used to declaratively format disks and perform system installation
###!
###! First we need to decrypt the needed secrets mainly we need:
###! * The disk encryption password - Used to encrypt the disks
###! * Private SSH host key - Required by NiXium to differenciate the system and ability to decrypt secrets
###!
###! ..in the ragenix-expected directory which is `/run/agenix/<SECRET>`.
###!
###! Then we pre-build the system configuration to avoid rebuilds and lesser the risk of failure later and initialize the disko-install payload after which the system will reboot into the new Operating System.
###!
###! Warning: For this payload to work we require that the disks that we are manipulating are not used to boot the current Operating System as otherwise disko-install will fail for safety. Use recovery disk or load a minimal nixos installer in the Random Access Memory ("RAM")
